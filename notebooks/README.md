## Notebook Overview

Those notebooks were originally develloped for the [Dark Energy school in 2019 in Paris](https://lsstdesc.org/pages/DESchool.html#de-school-x-paris-july-15-2019). There is the associated lesson on Gaussian Process available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qBfMgkspts) and the notebooks would help to reproduce most of the exercice that are presented in the lesson. The main difference is that those notebook are using `treegp` and they can give an idea of what is possible to do with it.
