Checklist for making a new release:

- Run test suite on as many machines as possible.
- Check the travis runs to make sure they are all passing.
- Update the version number to the desired M.m.r value in treegp/_version.py.
- git commit -m vM.m.r              -- commit this version with the right version number
- git tag -a vM.m.r -m vM.m.r       -- tag the current version
- git push                          -- push the commit to github (This doesn't push tags.)
- git push --tags                   -- push the tag to github (This doesn't push commits.)
- python setup.py install           -- to get the installed code with the new version number.
- rm -r treegp.egg-info             -- clear out old egg file if it exists.
- python setup.py sdist             -- build the source distribution tarball
- tar tvf dist/treegp-M.m.r.tar.gz  -- inspect the contents to make sure nothing weird in there,
                                       and that it has everything you want to include.
- twine upload dist/treegp-M.m.r.tar.gz     -- upload to pypi
- Go to another directory (or computer) and try
- pip install -U treegp             -- it's usually fast, but might take a few minutes to sync.
- Update the version number on master to the next M.(m+1) with no .r part.
