treegp
--------

treegp is a python gaussian process code that perform 1D and 2D interpolation.

treegp have some specific features compared to other gaussian processes available code:

*   It is possible to use informations from the 2-points correlation function to estimate hyperparameters
*   It is possible to perform the gaussian process interpolation around a mean function
*   Tools are given to compute the mean function

Waiting the paper, the description of the training can be found in french at least for the mean function
`here <https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01467899>`_ .
